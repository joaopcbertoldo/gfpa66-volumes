# Glass fiber-reinforced polyamide 66 3D X-ray computed tomography dataset for deep learning segmentation

# todos
 
 - updated zip files links
 - updated h5/xdmf files links
 - updated pymicro tutorial link
 - make the `read_h5` work
 - update description in zenodo
 - include link to this 
 - todo show how to do it with fiji --> add it to zenodo as well

We show how to open data in two ways:

 - from a pair of `.h5`-`.xdmf` files using [`pymicro`](https://github.com/heprom/pymicro)'s class `SampleData`
 
 - `.raw` files


## `.raw` files

**There is no special dependency to use it this way (apart from basic stuff: numpy and matplotlib if you want to plot). **

**You only need the `.zip`s and the module `read_raw.py` in this directory.**

Download and extract the contents of the `crack.zip`, `pa66.zip`, and `pa66_test.zip` files to this directory.

TODO add links

 - [crack.zip]()
 - [pa66.zip]()
 - [pa66_test.zip]()

The `.info` files contain the shape (`x`, `y`, and `z` sizes) of the corresponding files with the same name so that you don't need to type them.

The module `read_raw.py` has a function that will be used to load the files' contents into `numpy.ndarray`s - credits to [`pymicro`](https://github.com/heprom/pymicro).

See the notebook `read_raw.ipynb` for a brief demo of how to open the `.raw`s as numpy arrays - put the contents of the `.zip` files in a folder `raws` before. 

## `SampleData` (`.h5` + `.xdmf`)

Download the files below and put them in this directory.

- [pa66_volumes.h5]()
- [pa66_volumes.xdmf]()

Install [`pymicro`](https://github.com/heprom/pymicro) and follow the tutorial in `read_h5.ipynb`.

To see how the `.h5`/`.xdmf` files were generated, see the file `write_h5.ipynb` or check [this tutorial in `pymicro`'s repository']().
